#### Running a job through the HPCC 
##

## Need to log-in to development node (recommend  using dev-intel16)
ssh dev-intel16

## Need to load current versions of R, JAGS, and necessary GNU
# Only necessary to do do if you plan on running the job directly on the devlopment node, and not through a formal job submission
module load GNU/4.4.5
module load R/3.2.0
module load jags/4.0.1

## Need to transfer files over to MobaXterm (can drag from a Windows File Explorer folder)
  #These files include: data, R script, JAGS model, and qsub file.
  #If at any point you need to edit files after they've been transfered, use 'nano (file name)'
  #If at any point you need to view files after they've been transfered, use 'cat (file name)'
  
## Need to run qsub command on qsub file
qsub example.qsub
